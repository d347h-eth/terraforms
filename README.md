# Terraforms

Studying the code from [Terraforms by Mathcastles](https://opensea.io/collection/terraforms). 

## Motivation 

Started this repo the day I discovered this project. I think this is a masterpiece that deserves to be studied by other developers. I want to put the pieces back together so I can understand it better, and take inspiration from it in my own work. 

## Architecture

This is a mono-repo, containing the front-end (terraforms-viewer) and the back-end (terraform-contracts).

## Challenges

[ ] Show what terrains would look like in 5000 years
